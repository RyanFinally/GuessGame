This is a simple program which will ask you to guess a number and 
give a hint for every wrong guesses that you made.

We start by defining the key concept of this program 
based on the description
-finish     : A condition when the game ended  
-ingame     : A condition when the player are given the rules
              and guessing the number chosen by the program
-start      : A condition when the program ask whether the player 
              wants to play or not
-intro      : A condition when the program welcome the player and
              ask his/her name

Let us get into the detail.
finish  : 
- victory message
- defeat message

ingame  :
- rules
- play

start   :
- proceed?

intro   :

- ask name

Each of this key concept will be made as class
