# GuessGame
This program will chose a secret number in range of 1 - 10, and you have to guess the number chosen.

## Attention
This was made by me while learning Python OOP.
You might find many other type of this kind of program. They might be seem similar but I have no intention of plagiarizing. 
You also might find that I am not coding elegantly, well that is because I am new to this and this is my first time coding a project using Python OOP (even using github).

Feel free to give me advice.
Thanks

## Description
This program will be:
    - Run via terminal.
    - Using Python 3.

The concept:
1. Everytime the game is initialized, it will ask for player's name.
2. It will confirm, whether the player wants to play the game or not.
3. If player does not want to play, then the program will be closed. If player wants to play the game, then the program will proceed to give the rules.
4. The rules are :
    - Player will be given 5 chances to guess.
    - Each time wrong guess made then a hint will be shown.
    - If player successfully guessed the number chosen, then the game ended. A victory message will be shown.
    - If player does not able to guess the number chosen within 5 chances then the game also ended. A defeat message will be shown.
